# Hello!

![](DSC_1240.JPG)

I'm Alicia, a second year MPH student in the Department of Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases certificate at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Over the summer, I looked at an outbreak of Burkholderia in a hospital setting and will continue analyses on the project as part of my thesis.
